I want you to write the server-side script to extend the second project.
When the user clicks “submit” and the quantity test is successful, the page sents the data
to the server. The server then computes the total price. If the user ordered more than 50
widgets total, there will be a 5% discount on the total. The shipping cost is $8.74 if there
are no more than 30 widgets and $15.35 if there are more than 30 widgets. If the state is
‘KS’, a 4.375% sales tax is computed on both the widgets and the shipping. If the state is
‘FL’, a 6.265% sales tax is computed on the widgets only. There is no sales tax in any other
state. The server then send a page giving the model, quantity, and total for each widget; the
sum of costs for all 3 models; the discount if any; the sales tax if any; and the final amount
due.
DUE DATE: 28 Nov for section 01 [MW]; 29 Nov for section E1 [TTh].
